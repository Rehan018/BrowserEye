🎯 Conclusion:
BrowserEye is currently a basic browser automation tool with AI chat capabilities. It implements only 25% of the comprehensive AI browser extension vision described in the prompt.

The project has solid foundations but is missing 75% of the core features that would make it a true Comet-inspired AI browser extension, including search replacement, advanced automation, persistent memory, and page intelligence features.

To achieve the full vision, significant development work is needed across all feature categories, with search interception and multi-source synthesis being the most critical missing components.
